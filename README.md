# MQTTShell
This is a very simple app which gives one device, command line interface similar to SSH of second device using a MQTT connection.

This program can be used to connect to a remote device to which you dont have access through SSH (becuase of network connectivity/firewalls/Private IP).

To run this app, a Public MQTT server is required or you can use the MQTT sandbox of your choice.
